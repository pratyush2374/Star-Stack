## Note on Google Business API
Currently, the application uses dummy data for demonstration purposes as the Google Business API is not available. The structure remains in place to integrate the real API when access is granted.

## Project Structure üìÅ

The project consists of two main components:
- **Client**: A Vite React application
- **Server**: An Express.js backend server

### Client Setup üñ•Ô∏è

The client is built using Vite and React, providing a modern and efficient development experience.

```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

The client runs on `http://localhost:3000`

#### Client Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the client directory:
```
